<p>Thanks Jim. Yes, that‚Äôs what we have found too. It‚Äôs strange though: why do people click on our ads saying, ‚ÄúLooking for a great not for profit to donate to?‚Äù And people click. Lots of people. We‚Äôve been trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>My Question for Reid: I know LinkedIn struggled to find what made it ‚Äòsticky‚Äô with members. They ultimately realized they didn‚Äôt have just ‚Äòone‚Äô customer profile, but rather, about 3 - 5, each customer coming to LinkedIn for different reasons. How can we as not-for-profit tech companies do the same in our search for figuring out what is going to finally make us ‚Äòstick‚Äô with our members?</p>

<p>Investors often invest in things that feel safe and low-risk. Yet with impact initiatives as Reid says, are high risk. We agree. Good initiatives spend time with the community they want to empower and hire community members to join the team, and that, along with so many other factors to mitigate risk in humanitarian programs derisks it as much as possible. how do we convince investors that they should take a bet on big problems and big solutions when it still feels so risky?</p>

<p>Reid you mentioned you usually get introduced to people you bet on through your network. How do you ensure that can engage with POC and women that maybe not in your network that maybe closer to the problem and have better solutions?</p>

<p>How can we get great non profits in front of funders faster, and get useful feedback to founders who‚Äôs pitches aren‚Äôt great yet so we can get more great non-profits?</p>
<p>Mariah Lichtenstern</p>
<p>‚Ä¢a few seconds ago</p>
<p>Consider that the wealth and income gaps keeps founders from getting funding before they are even eligible for VC funding. Securities regulations impose limits on who can invest based on income and net worth. It‚Äôs like redlining for tech funding.</p>

<p>So much of social entrepreneurship puts an emphasis on this ‚Äòcharismatic leader.‚Äô Leadership is important, but this form of it can breed isolation and power inequity in organizations. Leadership can show up in different ways. Would love to hear if Reid and others fund nonprofits with distributed leadership and if this is a consideration/</p>

<p>Appreciate Reid‚Äôs point about learning about new ventures through referrals. Many great leaders don‚Äôt have large social capital networks. Social capital inequity leads to societal inequity. Who you know shapes one‚Äôs future as much as what you know.</p>

<p>I never thought the medical system could be any better given all the legacy ways of working until I lived in Japan. In the US I had to pay about $1000+ for my check up across 4 appointments while in Japan, I paid $85 (medication included), all in one visit! Love seeing this vertical integration work!</p>
